Simple Websockets
=================

A simple pure python implementation of RFC6455 websockets.
Heavily based on https://gist.github.com/jkp/3136208.
As yet still quite incomplete but relative to that gist is 
at least (with-in the code at least) clearer about it's defciencies
(i.e. it raises lots of NotImplementedErrors)
